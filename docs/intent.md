# Intent: Work Management

## Problem/Opportunity

Work is scattered across individual project repos, markdown files, and mental context. There is no cross-project visibility — no way to answer "what should I work on today?" across all domains (development, business, consulting, board, personal). Agents operating within individual projects have no awareness of the broader portfolio.

## Desired Outcome

A central system of record for all work — tracking state, flow, and priorities across every project — accessible to both agents (via MCP/API) and humans (via dashboard). The foundation that intelligent orchestration (Work Manager agent, Krypton) builds on top of.

## Why It Matters

Cross-project coordination is the bottleneck. Without a unified execution spine, prioritization is manual, status is stale, and agents can't operate beyond their individual project scope. This is the infrastructure layer that enables everything above it.
